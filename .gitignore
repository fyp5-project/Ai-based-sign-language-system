# TensorFlow / Keras / Models - if you don't want to LFS them
# but you DO want to LFS your actual model files, so these might be too broad.
# models/best_model.h5 # Example if you had an H5, LFS will handle .keras directory parts

# Data - if not using LFS for videos or CSVs
# data/videos/
# data/*.csv

# Static generated files (LFS might be better for large combined videos if they persist)
static/combined_temp/
static/*.mp3
